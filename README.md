Problem :
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common diabetes complication that occurs when the retinaâ€™s blood vessels are damaged due to high blood sugar levels, resulting in swelling and leaking of the vessels [1]. In an advanced DR stage, the vision may be lost completely. The percentage of blindness worldwide resulting from DR is 2.6% [2]. Therefore, diabetes patients need regular screening of the retina to detect DR early, manage its progression and avoid the risk of blindness. 
 
 Classess :[ No DR,    Mild,   Moderate, Severe,  Proliferate  ]![image]

Training :

  Given problem is to train the dataset which contain 5 classes so that model can able to distinguish the classes once model is trained on given dataset
